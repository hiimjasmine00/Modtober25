# ""Icon"" Kit
by [undefined0](user:13351341)

---

This mod simply allows you to set any icon for any gamemode... with varying results.


The mod will attempt to warp the icon to fit the gamemode, such as rounding out
cube icons for ball, scaling up waves for cube and so on which can lead to some...
certainly interesting results depending on what you choose!


Mod support:
- More Icons: Complete (slightly buggy) support!
- Separate Dual Icons: Partial
- Icon Gradients and Fine Outline: None
